# Smart Cart

The concept of the Smart Cart program is to create a convenient tool for organizing joint purchases within a family or among friends. The key feature is the ability to create segmented shopping lists with restricted access for different groups of users.

## Key Features:

1. **User Group Creation**: The ability to create groups such as "Parents," "Kids," "Everyone," and manage membership within these groups. (WEB)

2. **Personalized Shopping Lists**: Users can add items to a shopping list and specify which user group the information will be accessible to. For example, items for adults, such as alcohol, can be available only to the "Parents" group. (MOBILE)

3. **Notifications and Reminders**: Automatic notifications for group members when new items are added to the list or when it's time to purchase certain items. (MOBILE)

4. **Device Synchronization**: Shopping lists will be synchronized across different users' devices, allowing them to view up-to-date lists at any time. (MOBILE)

5. **User Profiles**: The ability to create and edit profiles where users can provide personal information and set access preferences. (WEB)

6. **Smart Recommendations**: The app can provide smart product recommendations based on users' past shopping habits and preferences. (MOBILE)

7. **Voice Commands**: Integration with voice assistants to add items to the shopping list hands-free. (MOBILE)

8. **Budget Tracking**: Users can set budgets for their shopping lists and track their spending. (WEB)

9. **Multi-Language Support**: The app will support multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base. (WEB, MOBILE)

## Technology Stack:

- Web: React for creating an interactive user interface, MonobankAPI (optional for payment of additional features)
- Back-end: ASP.NET (IdentityAPI, GoogleAPI)
- Mobile: Java, and various APIs for product suggestions

Smart Cart aims to simplify the shopping experience by making it more organized and collaborative, ensuring that everyone involved in the purchase process is well-informed and up-to-date.
